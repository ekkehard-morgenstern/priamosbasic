Priamos BASIC interpreter

This is a reincarnation of an older project of mine, rewritten from scratch with a minimal C++ language (C++98 w/o templates),
to simplify porting to other languages.

It is a work in progress, currently I'm working on parts related to the tokenizer.

Since I do not have much time to work on it, expect slow updates.

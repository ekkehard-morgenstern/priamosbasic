# Priamos BASIC interpreter

This is a reincarnation of an older project of mine, rewritten from scratch with a minimal C++ language (C++98 w/o templates),
to simplify porting to other languages.

It is a work in progress, currently I'm working on the interpreter itself. I plan however, to create a specialized implementation language that compiles to C++ for it, though, since I want to shrink it down a bit.

Since I do not have much time to work on it, expect slow updates.

License is GPLv3. Platform is unspecified as of yet, but I'm using G++ on Linux for development.
